==============================================

Commmand Wrapper Design Rule:

1. READ: Scalar Value
INPUT: 0 or more values of primitive type
RETURN: 1 value of primitive type
CLASS: COMMON COMMAND WRAPPER
GENERATOR INSTRUCTION: WILL MAINLY GENERATE THE STATIC METHOD

2. READ: Signle Record
INPUT: 1 value of primitive type inididating the primary key
RETURN: 1 instance of current type
CLASS: SPECIAL CUSTOM ENTITY FOR THIS SP
GENERATOR INSTRUCTION: THE GENERATOR CREATE THE CLASS THAT HAS BOTH THE DATA FIELDS AND METHOD
IMPLEMENTOR INSTRUCTION: USER CAN MANUALLY USE THE METHOD ONLY (AND CAN PLACE IN THE COMMON WRAPPER CLASS) IF THE SAME DATA CONTAINER EXISTS.

3. READ: Collection of Records
INPUT: 0 or more values of primitive type
RETURN: 1 custom collection instance of current type
CLASS: SPECIAL CUSTOM ENTITY FOR THIS SP
GENERATOR INSTRUCTION: THE GENERATOR CREATE THE CLASS THAT HAS BOTH THE DATA FIELDS AND METHOD
IMPLEMENTOR INSTRUCTION: USER CAN MANUALLY USE THE METHOD ONLY (AND CAN PLACE IN THE COMMON WRAPPER CLASS) IF THE SAME DATA CONTAINER EXISTS.

4. READ: Set of Collection of Records
INPUT: 0 or more values of primitive type
RETURN:  1 custom collection instance of collectionbase type
CLASS: SPECIAL CUSTOM ENTITY FOR THIS SP
GENERATOR INSTRUCTION: WILL GENERATE THREE OR MORE CLASSES. ONE IS THE CALLER AND 2 OR MORE IS FOR THE DATA CONTAINERS. ALL WILL BE IN ONE CS FILE
IMPLEMENTOR INSTRUCTION: USER CAN MANUALLY USE THE METHOD ONLY (AND CAN PLACE IN THE COMMON WRAPPER CLASS) IF THE SAME DATA CONTAINER EXISTS.

5. READ: Collection of Records: Generic DataTable
RETURN: an untyped datatable

6. READ: Set of Collection of Records
RETURN: an untyped dataset, containing set of tables

7. WRITE: Returns the Success (CREATE, UPDATE, DELETE)
INPUT: 0 or more values of primitive type
RETURN: true or false indicating the success
CLASS: COMMON COMMAND WRAPPER
GENERATOR INSTRUCTION: WILL MAINLY GENERATE THE STATIC METHOD

8. WRITE: Returns the primary key value for a CREATE operation
INPUT: 0 or more values of primitive type
RETURN: primary key of the created record
CLASS: COMMON COMMAND WRAPPER
GENERATOR INSTRUCTION: WILL MAINLY GENERATE THE STATIC METHOD
